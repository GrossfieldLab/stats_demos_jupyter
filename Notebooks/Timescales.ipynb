    "The purpose of this demo is to get you thinking about how the timescale of your measurement technique affects the answer you get.  Every physical process has one or more timescales associated with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an enzyme is synthesized and degraded on the timescale of minutes, performs a single enzymatic reaction on the timescale of microseconds to seconds, and fluctuates on timescales down to picoseconds.  What properties you measure will depend on *how* you perform the measurement, because each experimental technique has its own timescales as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think of a camera.  We think of a photograph as capturing an instant in time, but in reality a camera has a finite shutter-speed: the shutter is open for a period of time, and the image recorded is the sum of the signal that enters the lens during that time.  If motion is much slower than that shutter-speed, then effectively no averaging takes place, and we get a single sharp image.  However, motion faster than that shutter speed blurs the image.  The other relevant time scale is the cycle time: how fast can we record new images?  Varying these two times will have very different effects on the data we measure.\n",
