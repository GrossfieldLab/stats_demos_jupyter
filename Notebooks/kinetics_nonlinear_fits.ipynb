    "Consider the classical ways of determining Michaelis-Menten constants...  In the old days, curve fitting was hard and a lot of effort was spent linearizing problems in order to avoid having to perform a nonlinear fit.  One such method is the Lineweaver-Burk plot that uses the reciprocal of subtrate concentration vs the reciprocal of reaction rate. The problem here is that taking the reciprocal inverts the size of measurement errors, so small errors become large ones.  Moreover, the constants are determined by the axis-intercepts, which may be some distance from the data and extrapolations over long distances is always dicey.  Another method is the Hanes-Woolf plot which plots the substrate concentration divided by the reaction rate against the substrate concentration.  The problem here is that both axes depend on the substrate concentration, so typical methods of error estimation are no longer valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are still taught today because they provide an intuition into problem and because it's necessary to understand how the kinetics constants were found in older papers.  However, we now have access to fast and ubiquitous computing.  A much better solution is to use nonlinear fitting.  For example, set up the Michaelis-Menten equation in gnuplot and use its fit() function, and you'll get a very quick, very accurate constant estimate with error estimates that actually mean something!  For a more detailed comparison of the different methods and their errors, see the following paper: _Current statistical methods for estimating the Km and Vmax of Michaelis-Menten kinetics_ (10.1016/S0307-4412(96)00089-1)\n",

    "In general, why should you not trust a linear regression when plotting your data on a log-scale (or your linearized data)? The fundamental assumption of linear least squares regression is that the errors in your measurements are normally distributed with mean 0 and have a constant variance.  When you transform your data, you are now skewing your error distribution. This leads to unreliable estimates of your parameters.  Certainly, there are cases where such a transformation could be appropriate and the linear regression still work, but you must be very careful when using that approach.  In general, you want to look at a nonlinear least squares fitting method.\n"
